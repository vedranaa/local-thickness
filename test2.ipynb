    "\n",
    "You can use interactive matplotlib figure. However, this depends on how you run python and requires an appropriate matplotlib [backend](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/backends.html). If you setup supports interactive figures using `Qt5Agg` backend, the code below will start the interactive figure in a new window. You can use keybord keys (`left`/`a`, `right`/`d`, `up`/`w`, `down`/`z`, `pageup`/`e`, and `pagedown`/`x`) to inspect the slices of the volume. Make sure that the window is active (click into the colored part of the figure), and try interactive keys, e.g. `a` and `d`. Some keys might be reserved for other commands (e.g. left brings previous zoom level) so try finding out what works for you.\n",

    "If the figure does not show, or is not interactive, try some other (interactive) backends as shown below. Remember to restart the kernel when changing the backend. In IPython, you can activate backends using magic commands. \n",
