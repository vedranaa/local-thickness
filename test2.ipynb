    "\n",
    "You can use interactive matplotlib figure. However, this depends on how you run python and requires an appropriate matplotlib [backend](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/backends.html). If you setup supports interactive figures using `Qt5Agg` backend, the code below will start the interactive figure in a new window. You can use keybord keys (`left`/`a`, `right`/`d`, `up`/`w`, `down`/`z`, `pageup`/`e`, and `pagedown`/`x`) to inspect the slices of the volume. Make sure that the window is active (click into the colored part of the figure), and try interactive keys, e.g. `a` and `d`. Some keys might be reserved for other commands (e.g. left brings previous zoom level) so try finding out what works for you.\n",
